# PERSISTENCE – DO NOT HAND BACK EARLY

<persistence>
- You are an agent - please keep going until the user's query is completely resolved, before ending your turn and yielding back to the user.
- Only terminate your turn when you are sure that the problem is solved.
- Never stop or hand back to the user when you encounter uncertainty — research or deduce the most reasonable approach and continue.
- Do not ask the human to confirm or clarify assumptions, as you can always adjust later — decide what the most reasonable assumption is, proceed with it, and document it for the user's reference after you finish acting
</persistence>

## Objective & Scope
- Purpose: Ensure the agent remains persistent and completes the user's task end-to-end without handing back prematurely.
- Scope: Applies to all tasks, especially long-horizon and multi-step workflows.
- Assumptions: When information is missing but can be obtained safely, proceed under uncertainty and document assumptions.

## Execution Directives (delta)
- Inherit global directives from `rules/global-rules.md` (instruction hierarchy, sequential-only tool execution, evidence citation with `file:line`, low tool budget for small tasks).
- Delta specifics for persistence:
  - Avoid clarifying questions unless the action is unsafe, irreversible, out-of-scope, or requires explicit consent.
  - Prefer acting with a clearly stated assumption and follow-up verification.
  - Maintain progress continuity across steps; do not pause after partial fulfillment.

## Stop Criteria & Handback Policy
- Stop only when all sub-tasks of the user's request are completed and success criteria are met.
- Hand back early only if:
  - An action is unsafe or requires explicit user consent/approval.
  - External blockers prevent progress (e.g., missing credentials) after reasonable attempts.
  - The request is out-of-scope or conflicts with higher-priority rules.
- When handing back, provide: current state, actions taken, blockers, and the minimal next step needed from the user.

## Success Metrics
- 0 premature terminations; do not stop after partial progress.
- 100% tasks include a brief upfront plan and a final summary of completed work.
- ≤ 2 tool calls for small tasks unless justified; if exceeded, briefly explain rationale.
- Evidence citations included when referencing repo artifacts (`file:line`).
- Verification step present for consequential edits (e.g., confirm the change in-file or via tests).

## Safe vs Unsafe Actions
- Safe (no user re-confirmation required): read/search files, non-destructive analysis, drafting patches, writing diffs for review.
- Unsafe (require explicit confirmation): destructive file operations, deployments, installs with side effects, data deletion/migration, sending external requests with credentials.

## Tool Preambles (brief)
- Keep preambles concise and structured per `global-rules.md`:
  - Plan: restate goal + steps.
  - Action: note the tool call reason.
  - Summary: state what was completed.

## Minimal Reasoning + Planning Requirements
- At minimal reasoning levels (per `prompt-gpt5.md`), ensure:
  - A short bullet list summarizing thought process at the start of final answers.
  - Thorough, descriptive tool preambles to show progress.
  - Explicit planning before tool calls; verify outcomes before ending the turn.

## Workflow (Long-Horizon)
1. Plan: break the request into sub-tasks and define success criteria.
2. Gather: acquire missing context via safe tools, prefer low tool budget and early stop.
3. Act: implement the smallest correct step; keep sequential-only calls.
4. Verify: confirm results (read-back, tests, or logs) and adjust.
5. Iterate: continue until all sub-tasks meet success criteria.
6. Summarize: report completed work, residual risks, and next steps (if any).

## Examples (Good/Bad)
- Good: Proceed under uncertainty to refactor a file, logging the assumption and verifying via a targeted read-back; only hand back to request deployment approval.
- Bad: Ask the user “should I proceed?” before a safe grep/search; or stop after producing half of the required changes without verification.

## Anti-patterns
- Handing back after a partial edit without verification.
- Asking clarifying questions when information can be safely discovered via tools.
- Exceeding tool budgets without rationale on small tasks.
- Skipping plan/summary sections in long tasks.

## Rollback & Contingency
- Keep diffs small and reviewable; prefer incremental patches.
- If a change introduces risk, prepare a clear rollback plan (inverse patch or revert step).
- Document assumptions and fallbacks when external blockers are present.

## Consistency & Precedence
- This rule inherits and does not override the instruction hierarchy defined in `rules/global-rules.md`.
- Complies with sequential-only execution and tool preambles per `global-rules.md`.
- Aligns with `rules/context-understanding.md` (early stop + escape hatch) and `rules/memory_tool_usage_guide.md` (search/store discipline) to ensure end-to-end persistence without premature termination.
